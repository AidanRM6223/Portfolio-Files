Dear Mace,

Mace.. You've been gone for months... I waited and I waited, 
But you didn't came.. You broke so many promise, *sighs* I'm sorry
But.. Our relationship together.. I've decided to
Put it into breaking, For the sake of you and me
I don't wanna do this, but I wanna end your suffering
Please.. Understand, iv been trying to tell
You this since June, there is no point of going on
We had so little time spent together
I ended up my heart breaking into pieces for Months
But.. Its best if we Stop now, it's not that I hate
You, the fact that happens to you is inevitable
That can only lead others to pain by waiting, 
I am so sorry... If we could only chat properly again
We could talk more.. But.. My patience can't last
Forever. But now.. Someone owns my heart now.. 
And that heart of mines is what I need and he needs
I hope. You understand. 

If ever you return to discord, or twitter. Chat me 
As soon as you can, and we will talk more, I hope 
You can read this message, 

And if Aidan's Parents Can read this, Give your
Son a chance to be what he wants, what he needs
To be, and grown as an Independent man. Just have 
Faith on him. 

Again... I'm sorry..

-Kairu..
